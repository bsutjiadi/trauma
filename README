Input file requirements
The input file must be structured in the following way.
    1. The input file must be formated in comma separated value (.csv) format
    2. The input file must not be empty
    3. The file must contain a table that associates a patient ID with ICD-10
       diagnoses
        3a. The file must have a header line describing the contents of the
            following lines
        3b. The number of items in the header must match the number of items in
            the entries
        3c. There must be at least 1 entry in the table
        3d. The maximum number of lines is specified in the constants.py
        3e. The patient ID must be the first item in each entry
        3f. The patient ID must not be empty, and must be of less than the max
            length specified in constants.py
        3g. The maximum number of ICD 10 codes per line is specified in the
            constants.py file
        3h. There SHOULD be no gap between diagnoses. Every diagnosis after a
            blank diagnosis will be discarded and not used for inferrence. An
            input file with gaps between diagnoses will pass validation.
